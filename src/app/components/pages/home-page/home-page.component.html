			<h2>What is a Kanban Board?</h2>
			<p>
				A Kanban board is a visual project management tool used to streamline
				and visualize work, allowing teams to efficiently organize tasks, track
				progress, and manage workflows. Originally developed by Toyota in the
				1970s for manufacturing processes, Kanban has since been adopted across
				various industries and domains as an effective method for improving
				productivity and workflow management.

			<h2>How to Use a Kanban Board</h2>
			<p>
				Using a Kanban board is simple and intuitive. Tasks are represented as
				cards, which are organized into columns based on their current status or
				stage in the workflow. Team members can move cards across the board,
				from one column to another, to indicate progress and status changes.
				Through visual cues and real-time updates, Kanban boards provide
				visibility into the entire workflow, helping teams prioritize tasks,
				identify bottlenecks, and optimize processes for maximum efficiency.
